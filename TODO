BUGFIXES:
- Player falling down to void is stuck in place after teleport to spawn and unable to move.

TODO:
- Add boss bar display for the zone the player is in
- Add server restart on a timer (ShutdownController)
- Add scripts to restart the server automatically when it dies.
- Add scripts to restart Velocity proxy automatically when it dies.
- Add a very simple fallback server players will be put into when the main server is down.
- Add a countdown timer to the fallback server for when the server will launch.
- Setup players on login: invulnerability, fly ability
- Allow players to open chests, hoppers and other containers but not to pick up items from chests
- Allow players to open and close doors, trapdoors
- Figure out a way to guide players along the server, what commands are available, etc. (worst case a written book, best case an interactive tutorial, we can also put most commonly used commands on the side bar)
